          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>Our goal is simple: Make amateur soccer enthusiasts feel like they are professionals. We use modern web tools to share team data to help coaches organize their teams while keeping their players informed so they can elevate their game.</p>
          <p>We provide a one-stop shop for amateur soccer. Anything teams need to enjoy this game we all love, we strive to achieve.</p>
          <h2>Team Rosters</h2>
          <p>Create a team roster so you know and your team know all the players on a team.</p>
          <h2>Game Reminders</h2>
          <p>Email your upcoming game information (time, opponent, home/away, directions and yes, even weather). Share a pregame conversation with your team so you can let your team know who your opponent is and maybe some strategic tips for performing at a higher level.</p>
          <h2>Game Formations</h2>
          <p>If you are playing a good team and need to play more defensive choose a formation with more fullbacks. If you need to protect the middle of the field choose a formation with 5 midfielders. Or if you think you will dominate and you want to play with 4 forwards choose the 3-3-4 offensive formation. All popular formations are supported by Soccermatters. Heck, we even let you name your positions because these days, every coach names the positions differently. Soccermatters doesn't want to change how you coach, we want you to adapt the application to your needs.</p>
          <h2>Starting Lineups</h2>
          <p>Everyone loves their name in lights and here's a way to highlight your key players that have earned a starting spot.</p>
          <h2>Stats, Stats and Yes, More Stats</h2>
          <p>We here at Soccermatters love data and a big part of this application is sharing your team data with your team and keeping some data just for yourself so you can make key decisions needed to improve your team. Who scored the most goals? How many players said they were going to show up and didn't over an entire season? How many players haven't paid their season fee yet? How many players show up each week? How many games did a player start? How many games did you win in a row? How many goals have been scored against you all season. And the list goes on but one things is certain, if you enter the data, you'll be able to access it later.</p>
          <h2>Post Game Analysis</h2>
          <p>Share with your team the outcome of the game. Let them know who played well. What worked for you as a team and what didn't.</p>
          <h2>MVP</h2>
          <p>A team is nothing if they don't interact. Allow the players to vote on who was the MVP for the game as well as how good they thought the ref was.</p>
