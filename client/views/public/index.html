                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Our goal is simple: Make amateur soccer enthusiasts feel like they are professionals. We use modern web tools to share team data to help coaches organize their teams while keeping their players informed so they can elevate their game.</p>
                <p>We provide a one-stop shop for amateur soccer. Anything teams need to enjoy this game we all love, we strive to achieve.</p>
                <h2>Team Rosters</h2>
                <p>Create a team roster so you know and your team know all the players on a team.</p>
                <h2>Game Reminders</h2>
                <p>Email your upcoming game information (time, opponent, home/away, directions and yes, even weather). Share a pregame conversation with your team so you can let your team know who your opponent is and maybe some strategic tips for performing
                    at a higher level.</p>
                <h2>Game Formations</h2>
                <p>If you are playing a good team and need to play more defensive choose a formation with more fullbacks. If you need to protect the middle of the field choose a formation with 5 midfielders. Or if you think you will dominate and you want
                    to play with 4 forwards choose the 3-3-4 offensive formation. All popular formations are supported by Soccermatters. Heck, we even let you name your positions because these days, every coach names the positions differently. Soccermatters
                    doesn't want to change how you coach, we want you to adapt the application to your needs.</p>
                <h2>Starting Lineups</h2>
                <p>Everyone loves their name in lights and here's a way to highlight your key players that have earned a starting spot.</p>
